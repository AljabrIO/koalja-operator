/*
Package agency provides an API to access the ArangoDB agency (it is unlikely that you need this package directly).

The Agency is fault-tolerant and highly-available key-value store
that is used to store critical, low-level information about
an ArangoDB cluster.

THIS API IS NOT USED FOR NORMAL DATABASE ACCESS.

Reasons for using this API are:
- You want to make use of an indepent Agency as your own HA key-value store.
- You want access to low-level information of your database. USE WITH GREAT CARE!

WARNING: Messing around in the Agency can quickly lead to a corrupt database!
